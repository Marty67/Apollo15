### Prerequisites

To view the source code you need the Godot Game Engine installed.

```

### Installing

```
After installing Godot, click "Import" and find the 'project.godot' file in the downloaded source code. This will open up the complete project structure for you to view easily.
```
Alternatively, to run the game through the Godot Editor:

Or:
```
When in the Godot editor, press [Fn +] F5 to run the project from the initial scene, or if you want to run a specific scene, open it and press [Fn +] F6
