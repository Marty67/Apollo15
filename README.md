# Apollo 15

Apollo 15 is a space adventure game created by ten students as part of their Computer Science degree.
Global warming has increased to a point where oxygen has become scarce on earth. You, the captain of a star-ship, are looking to extract oxygen from planets in the outer reaches of the cosmos. As you near a viable planet, its electromagnetic waves disrupt your ships electronics and causing you to crash-land. You must traverse the planet to find parts and repair your ship, so that you can head back to earth.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To view the source code you need the Godot Game Engine installed.

```
The version used to develop Apollo 15 was 3.0.6
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
After installing Godot, click "Import" and find the 'project.godot' file in the downloaded source code. This will open up the complete project structure for you to view easily.
```
Alternatively, to run the game through the Godot Editor:

```
When in the "Project Manager" view in Godot, click 'Run'. Note, this will only work if you have opened the editor view for the project at least once.
```
Or:
```
When in the Godot editor, press [Fn +] F5 to run the project from the initial scene, or if you want to run a specific scene, open it and press [Fn +] F6
```

### Executing

Apollo 15 can also be played by running the executable file.
